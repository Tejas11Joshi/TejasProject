# TejasProject


CollabWrite-C is a real-time collaborative text editor built completely in C.
It allows multiple users to edit the same document together over a local network.
I used basic data structures like linked lists and stacks to handle text editing and undo/redo.
Multithreading helps multiple users work at the same time.
It can be used for team assignments, group projects, or note-making.
Teachers and students can use it to review and edit documents together in real time.
I also added features like file save/load, autocorrect, and autocompletion.


This project really helped me understand DSA, networking in a practical way.
